Technical Challenge 

This is a file that contains the answer to the Popular Typescript questions of the Fizz Buzz question

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 (or any given number). But for multiples of:

3 → print "Fizz" instead of the number
5 → print "Buzz" instead of the number
Both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15) → print "FizzBuzz"

The Rules:

If the number is divisible by 3: print "Fizz"
If the number is divisible by 5: print "Buzz"
If divisible by both 3 AND 5: print "FizzBuzz"
Otherwise: print the number itself
